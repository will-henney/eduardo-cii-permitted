* Plan of action for C II


** General things to look at
*** Effect of illuminating spectrum
+ We have the comparison between the Trapezium region and the \theta^2 A region for Orion
+ Comparison with other H II regions?
*** What is revealed by the fluorescent distribution of C II in Orion?
+ Interior surface of the warm ionized gas
  + Bounded inside by the shocked stellar wind?
+ Comparison with high-ionization lines
  + [Cl IV] 8045.62
    + Also 7530.80 but that overlaps C II 7530.57
  + [Ar IV] 4740.17
    + Also 4711.37 but that overlaps with He I 4713.14
+ Proplyd bow shocks
  + LV1, LV2, etc
+ Kinematics?
  + Are the C II lines good enough s/n to measure this?
*** Comparison with other fluorescent lines
+ O I and N I trace the near PDR
+ Si II has a diversity of distributions
  + This is the same electron configuration as C II, but n=3 instead of n=2
    + The wavelengths of equivalent transitions (so with n higher by 1 in Si II) tend to be shorter in Si II than C II by about 30%
    + Si II 4p \to 4d \lambda5041, 5056 is equivalent of C II 3p \to 3d 7231, 7236
    + Si II 4s \to 4p \lambda6347, 6371 is equivalent of C II 3s \to 3p 6578, 6583
    + Si II 4p \to 5s \lambda5958, 5979 is equivalent of C II 3p \to 4s 3919, 3921
    + Si II 5p \to 6d \lambda6818, 6830 is equivalent to C II 4p \to 5d 6257
      + But 6818 is not detected and 6830 overlaps with He I 6827.97
  + We don't seem to detect any of the pure recombination lines of Si II
    + 4f \to 6g at 6240 is same levels as C I 6460 (but not really equivalent, since we should use 1 higher n for Si II), but we do not detect it (presumably because of the low Si abundance)
    + 4d \to 5f at 7849, 7850 is equivalent of C II 4267, but we do not detect it
+ O II might have a fluorescent contribution, which could be relevant to ADF
  + This is treated in detail in
    + [[file:../../Orion-HH/muse-oii-permitted.org][file:~/Dropbox/Orion-HH/muse-oii-permitted.org]] has general description of the project
    + [[file:../../Orion-HH/oii-fluorescence.org][file:~/Dropbox/Orion-HH/oii-fluorescence.org]] has detailed calculation of routes for the fluorescent excitation of the O II V1 lines
    + 

** Atomic structure of C II (and Si II) 

*** Relevant papers
+ [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.426.2318E/abstract][Escalante:2012a]]
  + Excitation of emission lines by fluorescence and recombination in IC 418
  + V. Escalante, C. Morisset and L. Georgiev


*** Ground configuration
+ 5 electrons
+ 1s^2 2s^2 (^{2}S) 2p .^{2}P^o
  + Excitations of this give doublet manifold of excited states 2s^2 n\ell .^{2}L
+ Also, excited core metastable state:
  + 1s^2 2s 2p^2 .^{4}P
  + I think the lines marked as DR come from excited quartet terms
+ And doubly excited core
  + 1s^2 2p^3 .^{2}P^o
  + Has transitions to 1s^2 2s 2p (^{3}P^o) n\ell
    + At least this is what the Atomic Line List says
    + The Escalante paper says 1s^2 2s 2p (^{1}D^o) n\ell (for instance 3p)


*** Relevant excited levels
+ lower \to upper
+ 7231, 7236
  + 3p .^{2}P^o \to 3d .^{2}D
+ 6578, 6583
  + 3s .^{2}S \to 3p .^{2}P^o
+ 6257, 6260
  + 4p .^{2}P^o \to 5d .^{2}D
+ 6460 (recomb)
  + 4f .^{2}F^o \to 6g .^{2}G (L = 4)
+ 4267 (recomb, mainly)
  + 3d .^{2}D \to 4f .^{2}F^o (L = 3)
*** What are the relevant pumping lines?
+ 7231, 7236 can have their upper level directly pumped from the ground
  + 2p .^{2}P^o \to 3d .^{2}D : 687 \AA

+ The last column is the predicted intensity from recombination alone
+ Unfortunately, I don't know if their value for 4267.3 includes the 4267.0 component or not
+ Anyway, they get 4267.3/6578.1 = 58.55/28.06 = 2.1
  + If they included 4267.0 as well, it would be slightly higher
  + But including 6582.9 (unobservable!) would make it lower again

+ Good discussion in Sharpee et al 2004
  + Turns out that the C II 7231, 7236 lines are already expected to be 50% fluorescence
    + At least according to Grandi (1976)
    + This is multiplet V3
  + Description of morphology of the fluorescent contribution is hidden away in [[id:347AC3EE-D131-4BEF-9A94-71DC9FFFD199][{10/10} Perform line extraction, fuzzing, binning, multimapping all on linux server]]
  + The best C II line is V6 4267, which we don't have
  + The pure recomb lines that we /do/ have are
    + 4620.11 V17.08 - clean bit of spectrum but very weak
    + 4802.740 - messy blend with N II and possibly [Co II]
    + 5342.40 V17.06 - clean but weak
    + 6151.43 V16.04 - stronger than the others, more or less clean, except for O I 6156 on the red side
    + 6461.95 V17.04 - strongest so far and clean
    + 7519.49 - not in Sharpee, sky contam but subtractable

9. Do multibin combination for the ratios at constant s/n
   - [X] Pilot study for selected ratios.  Highlights are:
     - C II 7236 / H\alpha 6563 - shows wonderful swirls, presumably where thet fluorescent excitation of the C II line is highest, which should trace the inner edge of dense ionized gas in the nebula.  This has peaks (from inside to outside) at the LV bowshocks; at the *Ney-Allen Nebula*; at the filament behind LV6; /possibly/ the 177-341 bowshock; in a *270 degree shell* that starts in front of 177-341 and curves round to W past 159-350 shocks, then runs NW parallel to the SW lane (and yes, that is an extinction feature, the superposition may be conicidental), then bends to the E to run along just inside the high-ionization inner arm of the E-W bar (of course the appearance of a 270 deg shell may be illusory); then the E side of the *Big Arc*, which is the largest scale feature (to the W it becoes less prominent, which coincides in PA with where the inner 270 deg shell gets brighter - maybe it is blocking it); then finally, around \theta2A.  There is also a dip at the Bright Bar i-front, which must be due the C++/C+ transition

*** TODO Permitted lines
+ Extract O II and C II lines from MUSE
+ For the O II lines, we need to isolate the 4649 blend
+ For C II pure recomb lines 
  + We have 4620 supposedly ?!
    + Very weak and there may be another line at 4621
  + Also 4803 but blended with N II and [Co II]
  + 5342.40 - very weak
  + 6151.43 - might be good
  + 6461.96 - weak but should be clear
    + This is definitely the best bet for C II lines
    + Escalante:2012a have it being all recombination
    + Whereas 7231 and 7236 are 20 to 40% fluorescent in IC 418
+ N II lines
  + These are generally weak and must be a mixture of recombination and fluorescence
+ Si II lines
  + These are much stronger, also mixture
+ More O II lines from Manu/Adal
  + 4609, 4610 - Escalante:2012a says is 100% recombination
    + Terms are in LK coupling scheme
      + 3d 2D5/2–4f F[4]o7/2
      + 3d 2D3/2–4f F[2]o5/2
    + Unfortunately, there is an [Fe III] line at 4607
    + Also N II 4607 but that is weaker
    + 4607 to 4610 are blended in Manu and MUSE
    + The O II lines are well separated from [Fe III] in Adal
    + Discussed further below
  + 4596
+ [ ] Excitation of O II V1
  + Multiplet (quartet) is 3s ^4P \to 3p ^4D
    + Storey:2017a has more rigorous terminology
    + But backwards: UPPER \to LOWER
    + 2s^{2} 2p^{2}(.^{3}P) 3p .^{4}D_{o} \to  2s^{2} 2p^{2}(.^{3}P) 3s .^{4}P_{e}
    + ~2s22p2(3P)3p 4Do    -   2s22p2(3P)3s 4Pe~
    + E.g., 4649.13 is index 8790
  + Ground state is 2p3 ^4S
    + Resonant absorption 2p3 ^4S \to 3d ^4P (429.650 \to 429.716 \AA)
      + so that is 2.12 Rydbergs
    + Followed by decay to 3p terms
    + Need to make a diagram and work out if it is feasible
  + Velocity gradients in Big Arc will tend to make fluorescence more efficient
  + Interestingly, the analogous N I multiplet is at 8680-8719
    + N I and O II are identical in electron configuration
    + We see all these lines nicely in the MUSE data
    + They are all at least 95% fluoresced
    + [ ] We could look at the equivalent of the 3d-4f lines in N I
+ Case of the 3d-4f lines
  + These should not have a fluorescent component
    + /except that maybe they might if intercombination lines are important/
  + But they give the same abundances as the other lines (in Eduardo HH 529 data)
  + Strongest lines:
    + 4303.8: I \approx 0.63e-4 Hb  (Escalante:2013a)
      + Compare with 4649 \approx 6.7e-4 Hb
        + ODell:2010a have 4959/Hb = 0.7 to 1.0 in slits 10 and 11, which cover area of Adal's slit 6
        + Adal has 4649/4959 = 10 \to 12 times 1e-4
        + Eduardo (cut 2) has I(4649.13) = 11.4 in nebula and 24 in shock !!
      + Eduardo 4959/Hb in cut 2
        + 1.15 in nebula
        + 1.67 in shock
      + Seen in Manu data - about 5 times weaker than 4317 and 4320 (3s ^4P - 3p ^4P)
        + Which are themselves about 4 times weaker than V1
        + E.g., Manu has 4649 = 1.13 x cont
        + I(4304) = 0.01 x cont, so 13 x weaker than 4649 => I(4304) = 0.77 1e-4 I(Hb)
        + Within the errors, this is consistent with Escalante predicted, especially if we add in the 4303.5 contribution: 0.09 + 0.63 = 0.72
      + Observed in Eduardo: I = 2.0 (cut 3) and 2.1 (cut 2 neb), and 4.6 (cut 2 shock) !!!
    + 4277 complex
      + Strongest component: 4275.5 with predicted I = 0.84
        + Blended with [Fe II] 4276.84 in Manu
        + Observed in Eduardo with observed I = 1.6
    + 4609.3: predicted I \approx 0.66e-4 Hb  (Escalante:2013a)
      + Also, weaker component at 4610.2
      + Seen in Manu, but blend with [Fe III] 4607
      + Very well isolated in Adal: I(4609) = 1e-4 I(4959)
      + So this has observed intensity that maybe is slightly higher than predicted (by about 30%)
+ What states can we have
  + 3 outer electrons
  + Ground state is 2p^3 ^4S
    + 2S+1 = 4 => S = 3/2 so all 3 spins are aligned
    + L=0 so J = 3/2
  + Pumped state: one electron goes from 2p \to 3d
    + L = 0 \to 1 for E1 transition so must be a ^4P state
    + In fact *only* ^4P levels can be directly pumped from ground
      + At least I would have thought, although Escalante also mention ^4S \to ^4D transition, which has \Delta L = 2, so must be quadrupole
    + So 2p^2 3d ^4P has L=1, S=3/2, J= 5/2, 3/2, 1/2
  + If we pump the 3d .^{4}P level then we need the transition
    + 3d .^{4}P_{e} \to 3p .^{4}D_{o} in order to populate the upper level of V1
    + Storey has the following components:

    + Unfortunately, most will be blended with other lines
  + We should also get another route down via 3p .^{4}S:
    + 3d .^{4}P_{e} \to 3p .^{4}S_{o} followed by 3p .^{4}S_{o} \to 3s .^{4}P_{e}
      + which ends at same lower level as V1
