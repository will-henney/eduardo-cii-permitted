# Permitted optical lines of C II

Study of interplay of recombination and fluorescence in the excitation of the optical permitted lines of C II:
  * 7231, 7236: recomb + fluorescence
  * 6461.95: pure recombination
  * 6578: next to strong [N II] line
      * Subtract using the other [N II] line
  * 6779,80: dielectronic recombination, but very weak
      * Could maybe give a temperature diagnostic

May include the following datasets:
  * Spatially resolved linemaps of Orion with MUSE
  * UVES spectra of Orion HH objects
  * Manu's PPAK observations (in particular, map of 4267)
  * Other MUSE datasets: 30 Dor, NGC 346
