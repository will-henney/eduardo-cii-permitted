+ Good discussion in Sharpee et al 2004
  + Turns out that the C II 7231, 7236 lines are already expected to be 50% fluorescence
    + At least according to Grandi (1976)
    + This is multiplet V3
  + Description of morphology of the fluorescent contribution is hidden away in [[id:347AC3EE-D131-4BEF-9A94-71DC9FFFD199][{10/10} Perform line extraction, fuzzing, binning, multimapping all on linux server]]
  + The best C II line is V6 4267, which we don't have
  + The pure recomb lines that we /do/ have are
    + 4620.11 V17.08 - clean bit of spectrum but very weak
    + 4802.740 - messy blend with N II and possibly [Co II]
    + 5342.40 V17.06 - clean but weak
    + 6151.43 V16.04 - stronger than the others, more or less clean, except for O I 6156 on the red side
    + 6461.95 V17.04 - strongest so far and clean
    + 7519.49 - not in Sharpee, sky contam but subtractable
  + So best bet seems to be 6461.95

9. Do multibin combination for the ratios at constant s/n
   - [X] Pilot study for selected ratios.  Highlights are:
     - C II 7236 / H\alpha 6563 - shows wonderful swirls, presumably where thet fluorescent excitation of the C II line is highest, which should trace the inner edge of dense ionized gas in the nebula.  This has peaks (from inside to outside) at the LV bowshocks; at the *Ney-Allen Nebula*; at the filament behind LV6; /possibly/ the 177-341 bowshock; in a *270 degree shell* that starts in front of 177-341 and curves round to W past 159-350 shocks, then runs NW parallel to the SW lane (and yes, that is an extinction feature, the superposition may be conicidental), then bends to the E to run along just inside the high-ionization inner arm of the E-W bar (of course the appearance of a 270 deg shell may be illusory); then the E side of the *Big Arc*, which is the largest scale feature (to the W it becoes less prominent, which coincides in PA with where the inner 270 deg shell gets brighter - maybe it is blocking it); then finally, around \theta2A.  There is also a dip at the Bright Bar i-front, which must be due the C++/C+ transition
